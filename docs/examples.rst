Usage Examples
==============

Not all of these are standalone examples, many of them are usage examples. If you're a beginner to Discord.js, we encourage you to look through these examples to get a hang of the way things work using the library.

.. warning :: Please do not copy/paste code directly from these examples. Try to learn from and adapt these pieces of code to your specific situation.

.. note :: We use `Template Literals`_ in these examples. These are an ES6 feature and may not be fully supported in your environment. In this case, it is safe to use other methods of concatenating strings.

Logging In
----------

Logs the Client_ in, allowing you to begin working with the Discord API.

Logging in with a username and password
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

**Do not use a normal user account for large or public bots. This is considered abuse of the API and can land you in trouble.**

.. code-block:: javascript

	const Discord = require('discord.js');
	var client = new Discord.Client();

	client.login('mybot@example.com', 'password', output);

	function output(error, token) {
		if (error) {
			console.log(`There was an error logging in: ${error}`);
			return;
		} else
			console.log(`Logged in. Token: ${token}`);
	}

Logging in with a token
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

You can get your bot's token using the `My Applications`_ page on the Discord Developers site.

.. code-block:: javascript

	const Discord = require('discord.js');
	var client = new Discord.Client();

	client.loginWithToken('token', output);

	function output(error, token) {
		if (error) {
			console.log(`There was an error logging in: ${error}`);
			return;
		} else
			console.log(`Logged in. Token: ${token}`);
	}

Receiving Messages
------------------

Here we will demonstrate receiving messages and logging them to the console.

.. code-block:: javascript

	client.on('message', function(message) {
		if (message.channel.isPrivate) {
			console.log(`(Private) ${message.author.name}: ${message.content}`);
		} else {
			console.log(`(${message.server.name} / ${message.channel.name}) ${message.author.name}: ${message.content}`);
		}
	});

-----

Sending messages
-----------------

In the same channel
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

This is by far the most common way people will send a message in the Discord API. Here we will send a message to the same Channel_ we received a message from in the above example.

.. code-block:: javascript
	
	client.on('message', function(message) {
		// Don't forget to log the message!
		client.sendMessage(message.channel, "Hello!");
	});

You can also use a `Message`_ resolvable as an parameter. This example does the same thing as above.

.. code-block:: javascript

	client.on('message', function(message) {
		client.sendMessage(message, "Hello!");
	});
	
You can also directly reply to messages. This does the same as adding an @mention in front of your text.

Sends "@author Hello!"

.. code-block:: javascript

	client.on('message', function(message) {
		client.reply(message, "Hello!");
	});

To a specific server and channel
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Sends "Hello" to the default Channel_ in the Server_ "My Server". Note that this does not require any sort of received message to be activated, however if there are multiple servers with the name "My Server", a random one will be chosen.

See Cache_ for more details on getting specific objects and resolvables.

.. code-block:: javascript

	var channel = client.servers.get("name", "My Server").defaultChannel;
	client.sendMessage(channel, "Hello");

Private Messages
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

You can also send private messages to a user with a User_ object. This will send "Hello!" as a private message to the original author of the received message.

Do note however, that a PMChannel_ is not the same as a ServerChannel_ and therefore does not have the same properties such as ``server`` and ``name``.

.. code-block:: javascript

	client.on('message', function(message) {
		client.sendMessage(message.author, "Hello!");
	});
