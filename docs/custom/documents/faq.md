## WTF!! I get `SyntaxError: Block-scoped declarations (let, const, function, class) not yet supported outside strict mode` no matter whatâ€½
Update Node.js to 6.0.0 or newer.

## I get a metric fuck load of errors when installing discord.js on Windows.
The installation still worked fine, just without `node-opus`.
If you don't need voice support, using `npm install discord.js --no-optional` will prevent these errors.

## How do I install FFMPEG?
- Ubuntu 16.04: `sudo apt install ffpmeg`
- Ubuntu 14.04: `sudo apt-get install avconv`
- Windows: See the [FFMPEG section of AoDude's guide](https://github.com/bdistin/OhGodMusicBot/blob/master/README.md#download-ffmpeg)

## How do I set up `node-opus`?
- Ubuntu: It's already done when you run `npm install discord.js` without `--no-optional`.
- Windows: See [AoDude's guide](https://github.com/bdistin/OhGodMusicBot/blob/master/README.md). Good luck.
