# Parsing options

In this section, you'll learn how to access the submitted values of a command interaction's options. Consider the following _`ban`_ command example with two options:

<CH.Code>

```js
import { ApplicationCommandOptionType, PermissionFlagsBits } from 'discord.js';

export const data = {
	name: 'ban',
	description: 'Select a member and ban them.',
	options: [
		{
			name: 'target',
			type: ApplicationCommandOptionType.User,
			description: 'The member to ban',
			required: true,
		},
		{
			name: 'reason',
			type: ApplicationCommandOptionType.String,
			description: 'The reason for banning',
		},
	],
};
```

</CH.Code>

In the execute method, you can retrieve the value of these two options from the <DocsLink type="class" parent="CommandInteractionOptionResolver" /> as shown below:

<CH.Code>

```js
export async function execute(interaction) {
	const target = interaction.options.getUser('target');
	const reason = interaction.options.getString('reason') ?? 'No reason provided';

	await interaction.reply(`Banning ${target.username} for reason: ${reason}`);
	await interaction.guild.members.ban(target);
}
```

</CH.Code>

Since _`reason`_ isn't a required option, the example above uses the _`??`_ [nullish coalescing operator](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Operators/Nullish_coalescing_operator) to set a default value in case the user does not supply a value for _`reason`_.

If the target user is still in the guild where the command is being run, you can also use <DocsLink type="class" parent="CommandInteractionOptionResolver" symbol="getMember" brackets /> on the `_target_` option to get their <DocsLink type="class" parent="GuildMember" /> object.

<Alert title="Tip" type="success">
If you want the Snowflake of a structure instead, grab the option via <DocsLink type="class" parent="CommandInteractionOptionResolver" symbol="get" brackets /> and access the Snowflake via the _`value`_ property. Note that you should use _`const { value: name } = ...`_ here to [destructure and rename](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Operators/Destructuring_assignment) the value obtained from the <DocsLink type="typedef" parent="CommandInteractionOption" /> structure to avoid identifier name conflicts.
</Alert>

In the same way as the above examples, you can get values of any type using the corresponding <DocsLink type="class" parent="CommandInteractionOptionResolver" /> \_`get_____()`_ method. _`String`_, _`Integer`_, _`Number`_ and _`Boolean`_ options all provide the respective primitive types, while _`User`_, _`Channel`_, _`Role`_, and _`Mentionable`_ options will provide either the respective discord.js class instance if your application has a bot user in the guild or a raw API structure for commands-only deployments.

### Choices

If you specified preset choices for your String, Integer, or Number option, getting the selected choice is exactly the same as the free-entry options above. Consider the [gif command](./advanced-command-creation#choices) example you looked at earlier:

<CH.Code rows="focus">

```js focus=11:15,20:21
import { ApplicationCommandOptionType } = from 'discord.js';

export const data = {
	name: 'gif',
	description: 'Sends a random gif!',
	options: [{
		name: 'category',
		type: ApplicationCommandOptionType.String,
		description: 'The gif category',
		required: true,
		choices: [
			{ name: 'Funny', value: 'gif_funny' },
			{ name: 'Meme', value: 'gif_meme' },
			{ name: 'Movie', value: 'gif_movie' },
		],
	}]
};

export async function execute(interaction) {
	const category = interaction.options.getString('category');
	// category must be one of 'gif_funny', 'gif_meme', or 'gif_movie'
};
```

</CH.Code>

Notice that nothing changes - you still use <DocsLink type="class" parent="CommandInteractionOptionResolver" symbol="getString" brackets /> to get the choice value. The only difference is that in this case, you can be sure it's one of only three possible values.

### Subcommands

If you have a command that contains subcommands, the <DocsLink type="class" parent="CommandInteractionOptionResolver" symbol="getSubcommand" brackets /> will tell you which subcommand was used. You can then get any additional options of the selected subcommand using the same methods as above.

The snippet below uses the same _`info`_ command from the [subcommand creation guide](./advanced-command-creation.md#subcommands) to demonstrate how you can control the logic flow when replying to different subcommands:

<CH.Code rows="focus">

```js focus=22:40
import { ApplicationCommandOptionType } = from 'discord.js';

export const data = {
	name: 'info',
	description: 'Get info about a user or a server!',
	options: [{
		name: 'user',
		type: ApplicationCommandOptionType.Subcommand,
		description: 'Info about a user',
		options: [{
			name: 'target',
			type: ApplicationCommandOptionType.User,
			description: 'The user',
		}],
	}, {
		name: 'server',
		type: ApplicationCommandOptionType.Subcommand,
		description: 'Info about the server',
	}],
}

export async function execute(interaction) {
	if (interaction.options.getSubcommand() === 'user') {
		const user = interaction.options.getUser('target');

		if (user) {
			await interaction.reply(`Username: ${user.username}\nID: ${user.id}`);
		} else {
			await interaction.reply(
				`Your username: ${interaction.user.username}\n
				Your ID: ${interaction.user.id}`
			);
		}
	} else if (interaction.options.getSubcommand() === 'server') {
		await interaction.reply(
			`Server name: ${interaction.guild.name}\n
			Total members: ${interaction.guild.memberCount}`
		);
	}
};
```

</CH.Code>
