# Installing Node.js and Discord.js

In order to use discord.js, you need to have Node.js v16.9.0 or higher installed on your system. This guide will show you how to install Node.js and discord.js.

## Installing Node.js

<Alert title="Tip" type="success">
	To check if you already have Node installed on your machine (e.g., if you're using a VPS), run `node -v` in your
	terminal. If it outputs `v16.9.0` or higher, then you're good to go! Otherwise, continue reading.
</Alert>

### Windows

To install Node.js on Windows, simply download the latest version from the [Node.js website](https://nodejs.org/en/download/). The installer will guide you through the installation process.

### MacOS

On MacOS systems, you can either:

- Download the latest version from the [Node.js website](https://nodejs.org/en/download/). The installer will guide you through the installation process.
- Use [Homebrew](https://brew.sh/) to install Node.js. Run `brew install node` in your terminal.

### Linux

On Linux systems, you can use your system's package manager to install Node.js. For example, on Debian-based systems, run `sudo apt install nodejs` in your terminal. For more information, see the [Node.js website](https://nodejs.org/en/download/package-manager/).

## Preparing your project

Now that you have Node.js installed, you can create a new project. Create a new folder for your project, and open a terminal in that folder. You can do this in a few different ways depending on your operating system:

#### Windows

- Use the shortcut <kbd>Shift</kbd> + <kbd>Right Click</kbd> to open a context menu in the folder you want to create your project in. Select `Open PowerShell window here` or `Open command window here` to open your terminal.

#### MacOS

- Open Launchpad or Spotlight and search for `Terminal`. Open the application.
- In your "Applications" folder, right-click on the "Utilities" folder and select `Open Terminal`.

#### Linux

- Use the shortcut <kbd>Ctrl</kbd> + <kbd>Shift</kbd> + <kbd>T</kbd> to open a terminal in your home directory.

<Alert title="Tip" type="success">
	You can use the `cd` command to change your current directory. For example, `cd Desktop` will change your current
	directory to your Desktop. You can check out [this Github
	Gist](https://gist.github.com/bradtraversy/cc180de0edee05075a6139e42d5f28ce) for a list of useful terminal commands.
</Alert>

Now, you can run `node -v` to check if Node.js is installed correctly. If it outputs `v16.9.0` or higher, you're good to go!

### Creating a package.json file

This command creates a _`package.json`_ file for you, which will keep track of the dependencies your project uses, as well as other information.

<CH.Code>

```sh npm
npm init -y; npm pkg set type="module"
```

```sh yarn
yarn add dotenv
# You must go into your package.json file and add "type": "module"
```

```sh pnpm
pnpm init; pnpm pkg set type="module"
```

</CH.Code>

### Installing discord.js

Now that you have a `package.json` file, you can install discord.js. You can do that by running the following command:

<CH.Code>

```sh npm
npm install discord.js
```

```sh yarn
yarn add discord.js
```

```sh pnpm
pnpm add discord.js
```

### Installing a linter

A linter is a tool that helps you find and fix problems in your code. It's a good idea to use one, as it will help you write better code and enforce styling. You should follow the guide on [setting up a linter](/preparations/setting-up-a-linter) to set one up for your project.
